            <h3>🍔 Fight Competence</h3>
            <p>
                Fight Competence can be added by 2 through eating pizza, 5 by eating hamburger, and -3 by eating shit. By the way, a cat can only eat things when its mouth is open. When one cat lose all the fight competence, the game is over.
            </p>
            <h3>🤛 Hit Points </h3>
            <p>
                When two cats meet each other, the cat with lower FC lose its hit points. After 2 cats collide, they will go back to the initial position. When one cat lose all the hit points, the game will also be over.
            </p>
            <h3>🎮 control the cats</h3>
            <p>The game needs two players who control the two cats.</p>
            <p>The left cat is controlled by "q,w,a,s,d"</p>
            <p>q stands for closing and opening its mouth</p>
            <p>Similarly, the right one is controlled by "Space and 4 arrows"</p>

            <h3>🍶 the magic bottle</h3>
            <p>A magic bottle will appear on the table clothes for 10 seconds.</p>
            <p>If a cat gets the magic bottle, it will turn into a dog for 5 seconds.</p>
            <h3>🐶 what a dog can do</h3>
            <p>The dog has the ability to get points by eating 💩.</p>
            <p>Therefore, players can seize the magic bottle and try to get more fight competence.</p>
